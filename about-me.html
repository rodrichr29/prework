        <p>So I was born in Jan 29, 2003 at Fort Worth, Texas. I have grew up in Fort Worth till this day, and I had always been a weird kid during my childhood, like being a loner, an early foodie, a daydreamer, and even befriended a bully. My most recalled memory of my chilhood was the aspiration to become an artist. I really enjoyed art at that time because I would always be instructed to draw in a step by step fashion by my art teacher at the school, I truly liked the idea of inputing certain instructions to get an output. Sadly, I would later realize that I do not have the creative thinking that I would make myself to believe, and I dropped my aspiration of art. It wouldn't till later in highschool that I found programming.
        </p>

        <h2 class="post-title">Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Around highschool is where I started to pick up some hobbies for any free time that I had. I liked some hobbies more than others, but I'll list them anyways...
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cooking</li>
          <li>Illustration</li>
          <li>Debate</li>
          <li>Programming</li>
          <li>Gaming</li>
          <li>Chess/Logic</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now one of the most importants things that I learned in highschool was programming, and the reason I learned programming was for my extreme curiosity for it and because the school was offering IT/Programming classes.

        <h2 class="post-title">Why I want to become a Web Developer</h2>
        <p>Now the question is, why would I want to become a web developer? Well it's because since I was a child, I was always fond of logic and pratical steps to acheiving an output. As well I may not have the creative thinking for art but I still do enjoy making illustrations, which bonds well with front-end developing. As well I feel that through web developing I can learn more programming languages that I never thought I would learn. </p>
